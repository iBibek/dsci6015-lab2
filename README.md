In this exercise we are performing two tasks:

Task 1: We are using Linear SVM as a classifier in order to determine whether an email is ham or spam. We first process the dataset using MinMaxScaler and then fit the linear SVM Classifer. We received an accuracy of 0.80 in using SVM classifier with linear kernel. 

Task 2: We used Linear Perceptron using pyTorch nn.module  to classify sms and received an accuracy of 0.90. We used standard scaler module to remove the mean and scales each feature variable to unit variance.
