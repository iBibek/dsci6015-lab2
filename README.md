In this exercise we are performing two tasks:
Task 1: We are using Linear SVM as a classifier in order to determine whether an email is ham or spam. 
We received an accuracy of 0.80 in using SVM classifier with linear kernel. 

Task 2: We used Linear Perceptron using pyTorch nn.module  to classify sms and received an accuracy of 0.70.
